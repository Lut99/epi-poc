# EPI Proof-of-Concept Code
Repository that shows code and policies used in the proof-of-concept treated in a recent paper published by the EPI Project [\[1\]](#references).


## Structure
This repository contains two large segments of example code:
1. [`policies/`](./policies/) contains eFLINT snippets that examplify policy used during the proof-of-concept; and
2. [`workflows/`](./workflows/) contains BraneScript snippets that encode the workflows that drove the work done during the proof-of-concept.

Conceptually, the first is used to constrain the system to prevent it from doing somethings undesirable; the second is used to drive it to make it do something useful.

See the respective folders for more information.
