// This files describes the policies used in the EPI Proof-of-Concept using the eFLINT language.
// Both scenarios (the federated direct access of data, and training on synthetic data trained in a
// federated way) can use the same set of policies as expressed here.
// 
// An introduction to the eFLINT language can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/eflint/jupyter).
// 
// eFLINT can be used to check a certain model of a system for compliance. So the first step is to
// model the parts of the scenario that we are interested in. This happens in this file.
// 


// Defines basic concepts that we want to use in our model
Fact package Identified by String.
Fact task Identified by package * string.
Fact data Identified by String.
Fact domain Identified by String.

// Then, we define a few concepts that we can use to relate the first three:
Fact task-input Identified by task * data.
Fact task-output Identified by task * data.
Fact executed-by Identified by task * domain.
Fact returned-to Identified by data * domain.
Fact owned-by Identified by data * domain.
